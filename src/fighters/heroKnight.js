// Lacy: fighter #3 (code id 'hero-knight'). A grey-armoured swordsman with a white scarf (sprites: the Hero Knight asset

//   idle = Idle, run = Run, neutral special = Attack1, jab = Attack2, jump = Jump, fall = Fall,
//   any hit taken = Take Hit, and Death plays only when her stamina runs out in a Stamina battle.
// Only the jab and neutral special are designed so far. Every other move is a PLACEHOLDER that reuses
// those two sword animations until her real moves are designed.
